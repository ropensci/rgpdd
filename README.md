RGPDD
=====

***DEPRECATED*** 

This package is no longer necessary, as the GPDD can now be downloaded directly as `.csv` files from the KNB repostitory: <https://doi.org/10.5063/F1BZ63Z8>


This package originally provided an R interface the [Global Population Dynamics Database](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/cpb/databases/gpdd), where data was served from a no-longer-maintained API and provided only in the Microsoft Access DataBase format, both of which made access more difficult for R users.
